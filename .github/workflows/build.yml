# === GitHub Actions Workflow: Cross-Platform Build for Pong ===
# This workflow automates the build process for the Pong project on both Linux and Windows.
# It is triggered on every push or pull request to the `main` branch.
#
#  What it does:
# 1. Checks out the repository, including the SFML submodule.
# 2. Installs all necessary system dependencies for building SFML and the Pong game.
# 3. Builds the project using the Makefile (which also builds SFML from source).
# 4. Uploads the resulting binaries (and DLLs on Windows) as downloadable artifacts.
#
#  Linux Job:
# - Uses Ubuntu as the build environment.
# - Installs development libraries required by SFML (OpenGL, X11, audio, fonts, etc.).
# - Runs `make` to build both SFML and the Pong executable.
# - Uploads the final binary (`bin/pong`) as an artifact named `pong-linux`.
#
# ðŸªŸWindows Job:
# - Uses Windows with MSYS2 to provide a Unix-like shell and MinGW toolchain.
# - Installs GCC , Make and CMAKE via MSYS2.
# - Runs `make` inside the MSYS2 shell to build SFML and Pong.
# - Uploads the final executable (`bin/pong.exe`) and all required DLLs as `pong-windows`.
#
# This setup ensures consistent, portable builds across platforms and simplifies distribution.
