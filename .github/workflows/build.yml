# === GitHub Actions Workflow: Unified Build, Tag, and Release for Pong ===
# This workflow automates the entire CI/CD process for the Pong project:
# 1. Builds the project on both Linux and Windows.
# 2. Extracts the SFML version from the submodule.
# 3. Generates and pushes a new tag in the format PONG_SFML-<version>_<number>.
# 4. Creates a GitHub Release with the compiled binaries.
#
#  Linux Job:
# - Uses Ubuntu as the build environment.
# - Installs development libraries required by SFML (OpenGL, X11, audio, fonts, etc.).
# - Runs `make` to build both SFML and the Pong executable.
# - Uploads the final binary (`bin/pong`) as an artifact named `pong-linux`.
#
# ðŸªŸWindows Job:
# - Uses Windows with MSYS2 to provide a Unix-like shell and MinGW toolchain.
# - Installs GCC, Make, and CMake via MSYS2.
# - Runs `make` inside the MSYS2 shell to build SFML and Pong.
# - Uploads the final executable (`bin/pong.exe`) and all required DLLs as `pong-windows`.
#
#  Tagging and Release:
# - Extracts the SFML version from `external/SFML/CMakeLists.txt`.
# - Generates the next tag in the format `PONG_SFML-<version>_<number>`.
# - Pushes the tag to GitHub.
# - Creates a GitHub Release with the same name and includes the binaries.
#
# This setup ensures consistent, portable builds across platforms and simplifies distribution.
